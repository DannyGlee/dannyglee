<h2>FORGING CODE 💪</h2>


<p align='justify'>Hi, I'm Danny from Colombia. Since I was 16 years old, I've been passionate about developing software and creating great ideas through code. In the beginning, I worked with PHP5, but for the past four years, I've been using Object-Oriented PHP and the amazing Laravel framework. I've also spent the last four years learning Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB, and working with Java Script for powerful search capabilities. I develop personal projects, work-related software, and applications for different companies. I'm constantly learning and improving my skills in design, CSS (and its frameworks), testing, and exploring new technologies. I'm also a beginner in Java.  
Welcome to my GitHub — let's keep forging code together!</p>
